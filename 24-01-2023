1. function for finding the largest number in a list
def large_number(n):
    large=n[0]
    for i in  n:
        if large<i:
            large=i
    return large
l=[1,2,3,4,5,55,33,99,5]
print("largest number",large_number(l))

2. recursive function to add up to the given number
def recursive_fun(x):
    addition = 0
    for i in range(1, x+1):
        addition = addition + i
    
    return addition
result = recursive_fun(10)
print(result)

3. function for creating list of even number in given range
def even(n):
    evennumber=[]
    for i in range(4,n+1):
        if i%2==0:
            evennumber.append(i)
    print(evennumber)
even(30)
